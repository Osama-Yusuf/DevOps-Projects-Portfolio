# DevOps Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my DevOps Projects Portfolio! This repository showcases a variety of web applications deployed using different technologies. Each project demonstrates unique combination of tools, and technologies such as Kubernetes, Terraform, Jenkins, and Docker Compose among others. Below are brief descriptions and Technology Stack for each project included in this portfolio.

## Projects Overview

### 1. JuiceShop-K8s-Terraform-NginxController

A robust deployment of the OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately insecure web application, using Kubernetes, Terraform, and Nginx as an ingress controller.

**Technology Stack:** Kubernetes, Terraform, Nginx Ingress Controller

- Deployed a secure and scalable web application using Kubernetes.
- Implemented Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform to automate deployment processes.
- Utilized Nginx as an Ingress Controller to manage external access to the services in a Kubernetes cluster.

### 2. NodeJS-K8s-Jenkins-Terraform

A Node.js application deployed using Kubernetes, automated with Jenkins, and managed through Terraform.

**Technology Stack:** NodeJS, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform

- Developed a NodeJS web application with CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins.
- Managed Kubernetes deployments and automated service provisioning using Terraform.
- Ensured continuous integration and continuous deployment with robust rollbacks and zero downtime.

### 3. PHP-Laravel-K8s-Helm-Terraform-GitLab-NginxController

A PHP Laravel application, deployed on Kubernetes using Helm charts, with Terraform infrastructure management and GitLab CI/CD integration.

**Technology Stack:** PHP, Laravel, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, GitLab, Nginx Ingress Controller

- Created a PHP Laravel application leveraging Kubernetes for orchestration.
- Utilized Helm charts to manage Kubernetes applications.
- Integrated GitLab for repository management and CI/CD implementations.
- Configured Nginx Ingress Controller to route traffic and handle load balancing.

### 4. React-GitLab(trivy+sonarqube)-dockerCompose

A React application, deployed on dockerCompose with GitLab CI including Trivy and SonarQube integrations, containerized with Docker Compose.

**Technology Stack:** React, GitLab, Docker Compose, Trivy, SonarQube

- Built a React frontend application with Docker Compose for local development and testing.
- Incorporated GitLab for version control and automated pipelines.
- Enhanced security and code quality using Trivy for vulnerability scanning and SonarQube for static code analysis.
